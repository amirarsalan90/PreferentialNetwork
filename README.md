# PreferentialNetwork
This repository is an implementation of the work of preferential deletion in dynamic models of web-like networks (Deo & Cami, 2007). Figures in the paper are as follows:

### Figures 2 and 3
By running main.py, two csv files "results-nodes.csv" and "results-edges.csv" will be generated which then is used by plotting.py 
to produce Figure 2 and Figure 3 in the paper.

### Figure 4
By running neighbors.py, a csv file "neighbors.csv" will be generated which then is used by plotting.py to produce Figure 4 in the paper.

### Figure 5
By running degree_dist.py, the degree distribution plot (Figure 5 in the paper) will be generated.
